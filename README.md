10 patterns were used in project:
- Creational Patterns

   - Prototype<br/>
        for create nodes clone in Persistent set
   - Singleton<br/>
        for classes of viewing
- Structuals Patterns
   - Adapter<br/>
        for implemented interface TreeFunctionable in Persistent trees
   - Composite<br/>
        for collection all nodes in one strucutre
   - MVC<br/>
- Behavioral Patterns
   - Command<br/>
   - Iterator<br/>
